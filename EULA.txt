"Documentation" means the technical publications relating to the software, such as release notes, license entitlement descriptions, reference, user, installation, systems administrator and technical guidelines, included with the Product.
"Licensed Capacity" is the amount of each Product licensed as established in the Order. 
"Order" is an agreed written or electronic document, subject to the terms of this Agreement that identifies the Products to be licensed and the Licensed Capacity and/or the Support to be purchased and the fees to be paid.

"Support" is the support services program as further specified in this Agreement.
"Territory" means the country(ies) where Customer is licensed to install the Product as specified in the Order.
2.	SCOPE. Licenses are granted, and Support is obtained, solely by execution of Orders.

Neither execution of this Agreement, nor anything contained herein, shall obligate either party to enter into any Orders. In the event an Order is proposed by BMC and is deemed to constitute an offer, then acceptance of such offer is limited to its terms. In the event Customer proposes an Order by submitting a purchase order, then regardless of whether BMC acknowledges, accepts or fully or partially performs under such purchase order, BMC OBJECTS to any additional or different terms in the purchase order.
3.	LICENSE. Subject to the terms, conditions, payment requirements and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, BMC grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable perpetual (unless a non-perpetual license is provided on an Order) license to install in the Territory, access and use the Product (i) up to the Licensed Capacity, (ii) for Customer's and its Affiliates internal business operations, (iii) in accordance with the Documentation and the applicable Order, and (iv) make one copy of the Product for archival purposes only (collectively a "License").  Affiliates may use and access the Products and Support under the terms of this Agreement, and Customer is responsible for its Affiliates compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
4.	RESTRICTIONS. Customer will not:  (a) copy, operate or use any Product in excess of the applicable Licensed Capacity or other than as set forth in the License above; (b) modify, delete or remove any ownership, title, trademark, patent or copyright notices from any Product, or copy or partial copy of a Product;  (c)  disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to derive any Product source code from object code, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this limitation without possibility of contractual waiver; (d) distribute, rent, lease, sublicense or provide the Product to any third party; (e) use the Products in an outsourcing or service bureau environment on behalf of non-Affiliate third parties, or allow the products to be used by an outsourcing or service bureau provider on Customer's behalf; (f) provide a third party with the results of any functional evaluation, or performance tests, without BMC's prior written approval; or (g) attempt to disable or circumvent any of the licensing mechanisms within the Product.

No warranty is provided for additional Licensed Capacity, Product provided pursuant to Support or Product provided pursuant to Section 12.
6.	LIMITED REMEDIES. BMC's entire liability, and Customer's exclusive remedy, for breach of the above warranty is limited to:  BMC's use of commercially reasonable efforts to have the Product perform in substantial accordance with its Documentation,  or replacement of the non-conforming Product within a reasonable period of time, or if BMC cannot have the Product perform in substantial accordance with its Documentation  replace the  Product within such time period, then BMC will refund the amount paid by Customer for the License for that Product. Customer's rights and BMC's obligations in this Section are conditioned upon Customer's providing BMC during the warranty period (a) full cooperation and access to the Product in resolving any claim; and (b) written notice addressed to the BMC Legal Department that includes notice of the claim, a complete description of the alleged defects sufficient to permit their reproduction in BMC's development or support environment, and a specific reference to the Documentation to which such alleged defects are contrary. 
7.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, AND BMC, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. BMC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL DEFECTS CAN BE CORRECTED.
8.	SUPPORT. Customer may acquire BMC support services ("Support") on an Order for the total Licensed Capacity of a Product. Once Support is acquired for a Product, Customer is automatically enrolled in Support on an annual basis for all Licensed Capacity of that Product, unless either party terminates Support on all Licensed Capacity of a Product upon at least 30 days written notice prior to the next Support anniversary date. The annual fee for Support will be agreed upon at the time of each Order. A further description of Support is located at www.bmc.com/support/review-policies, and is incorporated herein by this reference. BMC may change its Support terms to be effective upon Customer's support anniversary date, provided that such changes do not materially degrade Support during the term of an Order. BMC reserves the right to discontinue Support for a Product where BMC generally discontinues such services to all licensees of that Product. If Customer terminates Support and then re-enrolls in Support, BMC may charge Customer a reinstatement fee.
9.	PAYMENT, DELIVERY AND TAXES. If Customer is purchasing directly from BMC, Customer will pay each License fee and/or Support fee upon receipt of invoice.  Customer will pay, or reimburse, BMC or when required by law the appropriate governmental agency for taxes of any kind, including sales, use, VAT, excise, customs duties, withholding, property, and other similar taxes (other than taxes based on BMC's net income) imposed in connection with the License and/or the Support fees which are exclusive of these taxes. For Products that are delivered electronically, upon request from BMC, Customer agrees to provide BMC with documentation supporting that the designated Product was received electronically. If Customer accepts any Product in a non-electronic format, there may be an additional charge and it is the sole responsibility of Customer to bear any sales/use tax obligation, penalties, and interest. The unpaid balance of each late payment bears interest at a rate equal to the lesser of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law. All Products are licensed FCA ("Free Carrier" as per Incoterms 2000) shipping point. The Products are accepted on the date BMC delivers the Product to the Customer either physically or by providing access codes for electronic download, whichever occurs first, however, such acceptance will not affect the Product Performance Warranty provided in this Agreement. 
10.	PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) BMC, its Affiliates or licensors retain all right, title and interest to the Product, Support and all related intellectual property and proprietary rights. The Product and all third party software provided with the Product are protected by applicable copyright, trade secret, industrial and other intellectual property laws. BMC reserves any rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. (b)  "Confidential Information" means all proprietary or confidential information that is disclosed to the recipient ("Recipient") by the discloser ("Discloser"), and includes, among other things (i) any and all information relating Discloser  financial information, customers, employees, products or  services, including, without limitation, software code, flow charts, techniques, specifications, development and marketing plans, strategies, forecasts, and proposal related documents and responses; (ii) as to BMC, and its licensors, the Product (excluding portions of the Documentation that BMC makes publicly available) and any third party software provided with the Product; and (iii) the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation, Product pricing information. Confidential Information does not include information that Recipient can show: (a) was rightfully in Recipient's possession without any obligation of confidentiality before receipt from the Discloser; (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without violation of a duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by or for Recipient. Recipient may not disclose Confidential Information of Discloser to any third party or use the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement. The Recipient (i) will exercise the same degree of care and protection with respect to the Confidential Information of the Discloser that it exercises with respect to its own Confidential Information and (ii) will not, either directly or indirectly, disclose, copy, distribute, republish, or allow any third party to have access to any Confidential Information of the Discloser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential Information to Recipient's employees and agents who have the need to know provided that such employees and agents have legal obligations of confidentiality substantially the same (and in no case less protective) as the provisions of this Agreement. (c)  Notification Obligation. If the Recipient becomes aware of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information, then Recipient will promptly and fully notify the Discloser of all facts known to it concerning such unauthorized use or disclosure. In addition, if the Recipient or any of its employees or agents are required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or other similar process) to disclose any of Discloser's Confidential Information, the Recipient will not disclose the Discloser's Confidential Information without providing the Discloser with commercially reasonable advance prior written notice to allow Discloser to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or to waive compliance with this provision. In any event, the Recipient will exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Discloser's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, cooperating with Discloser to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information.   
11.	DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES; LIMITS ON LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR VIOLATIONS OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS (SECTION 4), AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY (SECTION 10) AND FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS (SECTION 13), NEITHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR BMC'S LICENSORS ARE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, SUPPORT, THE PRODUCT OR ANY THIRD PARTY CODE OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST COMPUTER USAGE TIME, AND DAMAGE TO, OR LOSS OF USE OF DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF NEGLIGENCE OF A PARTY OR WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A CLAIM ARISING UNDER TORT OR CONTRACT LAW OR (B) DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL, DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID AND PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE TO THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES.
12.	TRIAL LICENSE. BMC may determine, in its sole discretion, to make products available to Customer without an Order and without charge.  Such products are deemed to be "Products" pursuant to this Agreement except that (a) they are provided to Customer solely so that Customer may evaluate internally whether to  acquire a license to the products for a fee, (b) the license term for such products is 30 days; (c) the Products are provided "AS IS" and without any warranty or support, and (d) the products cannot be put into productive use or included as part of Customer's business processes in any manner, unless or until they are expressly licensed and paid for under an Order. BMC may terminate all of Customer's rights and licenses to these Products for BMC's convenience upon notice to Customer. 
13.	INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. If a third party asserts a claim against Customer asserting that Customer's use of a Product in accordance with this Agreement violates that third-party's patent, trade secret or copyright rights ("Infringement Claim"), then BMC will, at its own expense: (a) defend or settle the Infringement Claim; and (b) indemnify Customer for any damages finally awarded against Customer based on infringement by the Product. BMC's obligations under this Section will not apply if: (a) BMC's legal department does not receive prompt, detailed written notice of the Infringement Claim from Customer, (b) BMC is not able to retain sole control of the defense of the Infringement Claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, (c) BMC does not receive all reasonable assistance, or (d) the Infringement Claim is based on (i) the use of Product in combination with products not approved by BMC in the Product's Documentation, (ii) the failure of Customer to use any updates to such Product within a reasonable time after such updates are made available to Customer, or (iii) the failure of Customer to use the Product as permitted by the Order and in accordance with the Documentation. BMC will not bind Customer to a monetary obligation in a settlement or compromise, or make an admission on behalf of Customer, without obtaining Customer's prior consent. If BMC determines in BMC's reasonable discretion that use of the Product should be stopped because of an Infringement Claim or potential Infringement Claim, if a court of competent jurisdiction enjoins Customer from using a Product as a result of an Infringement Claim and BMC is unable to have such injunction stayed or overturned, or if BMC settles an Infringement Claim on terms that would require Customer to stop using the Product, then BMC will, at its expense and election: (a) modify or replace the Product, (b) procure the right to continue using the Product, or (c) if in BMC's reasonable judgment, neither (a) or (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate Customer's License to the Product and (i) for any perpetual licenses, issue a refund based upon the applicable license fees paid, prorated over 48 months from the date of the Order under which the Products were initially licensed; and (ii) for any non-perpetual licenses, release Customer from its obligation to make future payments for the Product or issue a pro rata refund for any fees paid in advance. This Section contains Customer's exclusive remedies and BMC's sole liability for Infringement Claims.
14.	TERMINATION. Upon thirty days advance written notice, either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience on a prospective basis; however, such termination will have no effect on Orders placed prior to its effective date and such Orders will remain in full force and effect under the terms of this Agreement. BMC may: (i) terminate an Order and the Licenses to the Products on that Order if Customer fails to pay any applicable fees due under that Order within 30 days after receipt of written notice from BMC of non-payment;  (ii) terminate any or all Orders, Licenses to the Products and/or this Agreement, without notice or cure period, if Customer violates the intellectual property rights of BMC, its Affiliates or licensors, or uses the Products outside of the scope of the applicable Licenses; or (iii) terminate all Licenses and this Agreement in whole or in part if Customer commits any other material breach of this Agreement and fails to correct the breach within 30 days after BMC notifies Customer in writing of the breach. Upon any termination of a License, Customer will immediately uninstall and stop using the relevant Product, and upon BMC's request, Customer will immediately return such Product to BMC, together with all related Documentation and copies, or certify its destruction in writing.
15.	AUDIT. If requested by BMC, and not more than once a year, Customer agrees to deliver to BMC, within 30 days of such request, as specified by BMC either (a) periodic product usage reports generated from specific products or (b) written periodic product usage reports, to be provided solely when the product does not generate reports ("Report"). Additionally, if requested by BMC not more than once a year, Customer agrees to allow BMC to perform an audit ("Audit") at the locations where the Products are installed, during normal business hours to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Customer agrees to cooperate during any such Audit and to provide reasonable access to its information and systems. If an Audit or a Report reveals that Customer has exceeded the Licensed Capacity for a Product, Customer agrees to pay the applicable fees for additional capacity upon receipt of invoice. If the understated capacity exceeds 5% of the Licensed Capacity of the applicable Product, then Customer agrees to also pay BMC's reasonable costs of conducting the Audit. 
16.	EXPORT CONTROLS. Customer represents and warrants that it: a) will comply with the United States Export Administration Regulations and other U.S. or foreign export regulations; b) no individual accessing or using the Product is a citizen of or from an embargoed country (currently Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba and North Korea); c) is not prohibited from receiving the Product under such regulations; d)  will not acquire the Product for a person who is restricted under such regulations; e) will not use the Product in contradiction to such regulations; and f) will not use the Product for prohibited uses, including but not limited to nuclear, chemical, missile or biological weapons related end uses.  For Product exported from Ireland, EC No. 428/2009 sets up a Community regime for control of exports of dual-use items and technology, and it is declared that this Product is intended for civil purposes only. Therefore, Customer agrees to comply with both the U.S. regulations and those E.U. regulations and will not export in violation of the regulations and without all proper licenses. Any failure to comply with these regulations will result in Customer forfeiting all rights to the Product.
17.	GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or to the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof (each, a "Controversy") will be resolved as follows:
